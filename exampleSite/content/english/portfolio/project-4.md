In agile development practices, developers need to integrate their work frequently to fix bugs or to create a new feature or functionality. Jenkins is used specifically for continuous integration, helping to enforce the principles of agile development.

Jenkins is one of the most popular and leading Continuous Integration servers on the market today. This popularity is because, it is an open source project and a very flexible tool, which you can easily use it to automate all of the steps of your software delivery process on any platform.  It is designed to maintain, secure, communicate, test, build, and improve the software development process. Setting up Jenkins and running build jobs is not enough for a production infrastructure.

- Managing Jenkins: Security, Plugin management and add a build node.
- Automated builds: Freestyle project, working with Git, scheduled builds and up/downstream jobs.
- Configure and run builds in Jenkins from GitHub.
- Build a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment pipeline.
